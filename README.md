This project provides LitElement components for building dApps with OpenRelay
(or other Standard Relayer API compliant APIs).

It is a work in progress, and not ready for production use, but we'd love to
get people involved today.

Some ways you could contribute:

* Develop new widgets
* Clean up / style existing widgets
* Translate widgets to your native language
* Write documentation
* CircleCI integration
