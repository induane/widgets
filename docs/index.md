Welcome to the Interactive Documentation Site for the OpenRelay Widget Toolkit.
We are building a toolkit of
[LitElement](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element) widgets with the goal of
making it as easy as possible to exchange digital assets on your website.

This site provides interactive documentation for the Widgets we have developed
to date. Not only do we have documentation on how to use each widget in the
OpenRelay Widget Toolkit, you can trade Ethereum tokens right here from the
documentation.

Getting started:

* [Installation](./introduction/installation.html) - If you want to incorporate
  OpenRelay's widgets into your own site, start here.
* [Widgets](./widgets/or-web3.md) - If you just want to explore the widgets,
  start here.

The OpenRelay Widget Toolkit is an open source project, and we invite
[contributions](./introduction/contributing.html) from anyone who is willing to
help out.

Also be sure to check out our [affiliates program](./introduction/affiliates.html)
to see how you can reap the rewards from building on OpenRelay.
