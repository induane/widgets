The OpenRelay Widget Toolkit is a framework for adding Ethereum trading
capabilities to any webpage with minimal effort. It provides several smaller
widgets, which are composed into a handful of larger widgets. The larger
widgets can be embedded directly in a website to enable trading, or the smaller
widgets can be wired together using JavaScript to build customized trading
interfaces.

To get started:

* [Installing the Widget Toolkit](./installation.html)
* [The Web3 Layer](./web3.html)
* [JavaScript Integrations](./javascript.html)
* [Contributing](./contributing.html)
